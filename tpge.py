Tiny Python Game Engine

This module provides a very simple Python game engine for writing elementary
turn based games with primitive 2D graphics in a 640x480 window.

PLATFORMS: This module provides a wrapper around John Zelle's graphics
library (http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py).

INSTALLATION: Put this file somewhere where Python can see it.

OVERVIEW: TPGE games function in a 640x480 window whose origin is in the
lower left corner, and make use of the following data model:
- A Point is a pair (X,Y) of integers where 0 <= X <= 640 and
  0 <= Y <= 480.
- A Color is one of the constants RED, BLUE, GREEN, BLACK, or YELLOW.
- A Line Segment is a 4-tuple (X1,Y1,X2,Y2) where (X1,Y1) and (X2,Y2) are
  points.
- A Circle is a triple (X,Y,R) of integers where (X,Y) describe a point
  and R defines the radius of the circle.
- A Rectangle is a 5-tuple (X1,Y1,X2,Y2,C) where (X1,Y1) and (X2,Y2) are
  points defining the opposite corners of a rectangle and C is a Color
  defining the Rectangle's fill color.
- A Text is a 4-tuple (S,X,Y,H) where S is a string, (X,Y) describe a point
  on which the text is centered, and H is an integer in the interval [5,37)
  defining the font size to be used in drawing the text.
- An Image is either a Line Segment, a Circle, Rectangle, or a Text.
- An Image List is a list of Images.
- A State is whatever kind of Python data structure the game developer
  chooses.

The engine assumes that the following functions will be defined by the
game developer:
- initial_state : State
  initial_state() returns the initial state of the game.
- successor_state : State x Point -> State
  successor_state(S,P) returns the successor state of the game resulting
  from clicking point P in state S.
- game_over : State -> Boolean
  game_over(S) is true if and only if the game is over in state S.
- images : State -> Image List
  images(S) is the list of Images that need to be drawn to the screen in
  order to present the state S to the user.
- game_title : String
  game_title() returns the name of the game which serves as the window
  title
